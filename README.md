## Concept
What is Animation? Animation is the transition from one state to another. Thus generally any animation could be made up of three factors: the initial state, the final state and the duration.

At anytime during the transition, the intermediate state which is also called a frame could be calculated automatically based on these factors. And Easing functions are often used to process the time-varying params to make the motion more dynamic.
